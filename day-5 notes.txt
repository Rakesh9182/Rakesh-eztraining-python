                   FUNCTIONS
*classfications:
1.pure defined
2.user defined


for code resuability,we use functions: we want to use particular concept multiple times in our program instead of writing the same code many 
times we can write it once,include  that inside a function and can call the function wherever we need it .


*TYPES:
1.functions without arguement,without return value.
2.functions without arguememt,with return value.
3.functions with arguement,with return value.
4.functions with arguement,without return value.

                      RECURSIVE FUNCTION

# A function which calls itself is called recursive function.
# this concept is called recursion.
